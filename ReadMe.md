#  Last-Mile Delivery Route Optimizer (India)
Developed by a UNT MS Data Science Alum, this project optimizes delivery sequences in high-congestion Indian urban neighborhoods using Graph Theory.

##  Live Demo
[Link will go here once we deploy!]

##  Features
- **Real-world Mapping**: Uses OSMnx to fetch actual street networks.
- **Traffic Modeling**: Includes a "Congestion Factor" to simulate Indian peak-hour traffic.
- **TSP Optimization**: Uses a Greedy Nearest Neighbor algorithm to reduce travel time.

##  Project Structure
- `app.py`: Production-ready Streamlit application.
- `Maps Project.ipynb`: Research, data exploration, and initial algorithm testing.
